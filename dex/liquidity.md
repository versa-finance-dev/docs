# üè¶ Liquidity

You can only swap tokens on Versa DEX if there is enough liquidity for those tokens. If nobody has added much liquidity for the token or tokens you want to swap, it will be difficult, expensive, or impossible to do so.

Providing liquidity allows the contributor to earn 0.02% from each trade for the pair they've provided. In addition, you can stake your liquidity to earn even more rewards! You can read more in the ["Farm"](broken-reference) section of this documentation.

### Providing liquidity

If you want to provide the liquidity, you should go to the ["Pool"](https://versa.finance/pool) page and press the "Add Liquidity" button :

Then select a pair and press "Supply":

You can remove liquidity at any time.
